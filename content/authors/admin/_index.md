## About Me

As a software engineering student, I am highly focused on applying advanced technologies to support continued digital evolution. With practical experience in the world of multilevel marketing, I have a deep understanding of the market and how to move products through platforms such as FB Marketplace and Shopee. While continuing to learn, I am looking for freelance opportunities that will broaden my understanding of software engineering and sharpen the communication skills I have mastered.
