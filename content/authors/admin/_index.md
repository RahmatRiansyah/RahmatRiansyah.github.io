    summary: |
      Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## About Me

As a software engineering student, I am highly focused on applying advanced technologies to support continued digital evolution. With practical experience in the world of multilevel marketing, I have a deep understanding of the market and how to move products through platforms such as FB Marketplace and Shopee. While continuing to learn, I am looking for freelance opportunities that will broaden my understanding of software engineering and sharpen the communication skills I have mastered.
